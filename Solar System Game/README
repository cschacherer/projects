For this project, we ran into problems with the database and the webpage.  We wanted to show that with an admin login, you could play the game and it would open a webpage on a localhost.  When we were merging, we lost a browser file that made it work and we haven't been able to fix it, but we included a screenshot of what it looks like.  Also, we didn't have time to implement it on the ui, but we can delete from the database.  

Also, while it was not shown in our video or presentation, we have a register form where a new user can be created and then start at the beginning of the game.
